## About the Code
This is coded using TypeScript, so any changes should be made in the ts folder script file **"main.ts"**, then compiled using `tsc` to generate the output **"main.js"** javascript file.  

Unfortunately, the output javascript file will not retain a lot of the formatting applied in the .ts file. However, this shouldn't really matter since the main coding file should only be the **main.ts** code file :)

Contributions / suggestions are certainly welcome - Create "Issues", clone the project, and create pull requests as required.
